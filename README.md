# Algorithms & Programming Paradigms With Python

According to my self-taught program, I have decided to divide the main topics into two parts and learn some of them with C, and the rest with Python. I am extremely happy to have learned foundational topics on data structures with C. However, I now realize that I need to have a comprehensive understanding of Python, rather than just limiting myself to the initially chosen topics. Below is my initial roadmap, which primarily focuses on learning with Python, but I plan to include much more in this repository:

- Algorithms
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Breadth-first Search
  - Depth-first Search
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Recursion
- Big O
- Object Oriented Programming
- Functional Programming
- Numpy, Pandas, PySpark

Until now, I used to watch theoretical videos and lessons, but I have now shifted my preference to solving problems directly and learning through a hands-on approach. I made this change in my study method because I believe that extensive coding practice helps me maintain my motivation. I have already gone through almost all of the lectures in [this repository](https://github.com/senatn/data-structures-and-memory) and covered the subjects mentioned above. Therefore, I will be following this [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) created by [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/@NeetCode/about)

And, of course, I will continue to share the resources I use here.
